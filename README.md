# What is `paddleballjs`
`paddleballjs` is a lightweight clone of React. I built it because I will never use React because I'm put off by the fact that it's made by Facebook.
## Name origin
It's from an [NPM expansion](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions/blob/HEAD/expansions.txt). The full expansion is `November's Paddleball Marathon`.
## Usage
Just use a standard JSX compiler and link the compiled result, along with `index.js`.
